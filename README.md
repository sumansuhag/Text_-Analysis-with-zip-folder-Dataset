 This project focuses on extracting and analyzing the contents of a ZIP folder that includes various files related to a business analysis. By leveraging data and visualization tools, the goal is to explore customer behavior, present key findings, and offer actionable insights to improve decision-making processes.

üîçProject Overview:

The Text Analysis with ZIP Folder Dataset project involves unpacking and analyzing an array of files from a ZIP archive that contains a mix of documents, data files, and visual content. The objective is to:
Extract and examine key datasets to reveal customer behavior patterns.
Summarize findings through comprehensive reports and visualizations.
Present insights that can drive strategic business decisions.

üìÅ Dataset Details: 

The ZIP file, named 20211030 Test Assignment-20250107T053720Z-001.zip, contains the following 8 files:
File Name	File Type	Size (KB)	Description:
assignment_report.pdf	PDF	500	A detailed report summarizing the test assignment findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
data_analysis.xlsx	Excel	1,000	Raw data and analysis results, including charts and pivot tables for visual data representation.
customer_data.csv	CSV	500	A dataset with customer demographics and purchase history, essential for understanding customer behavior.
visualization1.jpg	JPEG	300	A graphical illustration of key metrics and trends identified in the assignment.
presentation.pptx	PowerPoint	5,000	A presentation summarizing the project with key visuals, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders.
summary.txt	Text	100	A brief summary providing context for the dataset and its relevance to the analysis.
image_overview.png	PNG	250	An overview image visually representing the data analysis process and outcomes.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps in the Project: The ZIP file is extracted to the /extracted_files directory, organizing the contents into subfolders for images and documents.
unzip 20211030_Test_Assignment.zip -d extracted_files
Analyze the Files
The contents of the files are explored and analyzed for deeper insights. Here‚Äôs how we process each type of file:

PDF Report (assignment_report.pdf): A comprehensive report summarizing findings, offering conclusions, and making recommendations based on data analysis.

Excel File (data_analysis.xlsx): This file contains raw data, analysis results, and visualizations like pivot tables and charts.

CSV File (customer_data.csv): Data on customer demographics and purchase history is explored for trends and patterns.

Text File (summary.txt): A brief overview that serves as the introduction to the dataset.

Images (visualization1.jpg & image_overview.png): These graphical representations highlight trends, key metrics, and analysis results.

PowerPoint (presentation.pptx): A visual presentation summarizing the project for stakeholders.

Data Exploration & Visualization
Using Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the raw data is processed, visualized, and analyzed. For example:
Identifying customer segments based on demographics and purchase behavior.
Visualizing trends and patterns in the customer data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.


Insights and Recommendations
After analysis, actionable business insights are derived, such as:
Customer demographics that correlate with higher purchasing behavior.
Key trends that can inform marketing and product strategies.
Suggestions to improve customer engagement and retention.

üîëKey Insights and Results: Customer Behavior Analysis:

Insights into customer demographics and their impact on purchase history.
Sales Trends: Visualization of seasonal and regional trends based on customer purchasing patterns.
Strategic Recommendations: Optimizing marketing campaigns by targeting customer segments that show the highest purchasing potential.
